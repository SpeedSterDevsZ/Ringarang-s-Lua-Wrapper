# Ringarang-s-Lua-Wrapper

This is a Roblox Exploit Dll Lua Wrapper (dll source for roblox xploits)

Before i continue, i want to say THIS ISNT MADE BY ME! Ringarang made this.

Kinda skidded of axon? IDK. Looks similar.

What do i do?

Update the Addresses, CCV, And SC and Other Stuff and It should work.

If the console get's a input, remove the getline (probably wont even be there idfk)

Oh and this isn't updated, SINCE FEB 2019. So start getting addresses :)
